📱 Movie App – Project Introduction

The Movie App is a mobile/web application developed to provide users with information about the latest and popular movies. The main objective of this project is to create a user-friendly platform where users can browse movies, view details such as ratings, reviews, cast, trailers, and search for their favorite films easily.

This application is developed using modern technologies such as frontend frameworks (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript / React) and a backend system (such as Node.js or Firebase) to manage movie data efficiently. The app may also integrate external APIs like The Movie Database (TMDb) to fetch real-time movie information.

The Movie App aims to enhance user experience by providing features like:

🔍 Search functionality

🎬 Movie categories (Trending, Top Rated, Upcoming)

⭐ Ratings and reviews

❤️ Add to favorites or watchlist

Overall, this project helps in understanding full-stack development, API integration, and user interface design while building a practical and interactive entertainment application.
